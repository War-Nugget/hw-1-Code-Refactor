#Homework 1, Code refactor 

By Sahil Patel

# Code-refactor was the first homework assignment I was given during my time at the Georgia Tech coding bootcamp. This assignment was very fun and teaches you how semantic elements allow for easier navigating through a html document and to never repeat code. Repeating code not only makes maintaining much more difficult, it makes an application or website run that much slower.

## My steps included:


## 1. Evaluate the CSS and HTML files given to me.

- View all the different elements in the code in oder to decipher what needs to be edited.
- I checked the div tags and noticed that they were mostly div elements with no semantic elements.
- The CSS code had a lot of repeat code that could be easily avoided.
- The "img" tags did not have "alt" atributes, including the image background located in the CSS file.
- The "title" of the website is bland and needed to be changed.

## 2. I then began making changes to the HTML.

- I made changes to the classes regarding the two sections to allow for easier styling.
- I changed the title to "Horiseon Website" instead of just "website".
- I changed the div elements into a more semantic style of code.
- I added comments to what I changed in the code while also adding comments to what each section does.

## 3. I then made changes to the CSS file.

- First began changing any div elements in CSS file to match HTML.
- Then Trimmed the repeat code to allow for faster processing.
- I added comments to which lines of repeat code I trimmed.

## 4. I finally made sure all the code looks good and the wedsite runs and look perfect.
- Tesitng links
- Testing different screen sizes.
