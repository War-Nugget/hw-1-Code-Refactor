#Homework 1, Code refactor 

By Sahil Patel

# Code-refactor was the first homework assignment I was given during my time at the Georgia Tech coding bootcamp.

My steps included:

## 1. Evaluate the CSS and HTML files given to me.

- View all the different elements in the code in oder to decipher what needs to be edited.
- I checked the div tags and noticed that they were mostly div elements with no semantic elements.
- The CSS code had a lot of repeat code that could be easily avoided.
- The "img" tags did not have "alt" atributes, including the image background located in the CSS file.
- The "title" of the website is bland and needed to be changed.

## 2. I then began making changes to the HTML.

- I made changes to the classes regarding the two sections
